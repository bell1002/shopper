            For most people, online shopping has played an important part in everyday life. Online shopping is suitable for people who are too busy to go out or just enjoy the convenience of ordering things online. There are numerous things available online: clothes, furniture, food & drinks, household appliances and even … motorbikes. The online shopping routine is different for everyone. Lots of people shop online everyday. Some others shop online once a week and some people only do it once a month. People can directly contact shops to order or they can purchase things through e-commerce websites. Some popular online shopping sites are: Amazon, Taobao, Shopee, Tiki, Lazada,… Thanks to online shopping, people can save lots of time. I believe that online shopping will continue to improve and develop in the future.
